## Whole genome resequencing data

We completed two rounds of WGRS with paired end illumina Novaseqlanes. The first was aimed at thorough sampling of type 2, type 5, and Cassia crossbills (type 9) and was completed via BGI (n=92). The second was aimed at generating global taxonomic sampling with tissue from as many species, subspecies, and ecotypes as we could get our hands on. This second batch was done with Azenta (n=125). Details on each batch are below.

### 2021 WGRS at BGI
A list of fastq IDs and associated information on each bird sequenced during this round can be found in `BGI_2021_fastq_sample_info.csv`. There is data for 92 birds here: 30 *Loxia curvirostra* type 2, 26 *Loxia curvirostra* type 5, 30 *Loxia sinesciurus*, 3 *Loxia leucoptera*, and 3 *Loxia curvirostra poliogyna* (Atlas Mts., Morrocco).

Fastq files are on Parchman's storage server (`ponderosa:/backups/rawdata_to_backup/xbill_WGRS/BGI_2022_259/Clean/`).


### 2023 WGRS at Azenta

This sequencing round included more extensive and broad taxonomic and ecotypic sampling. A list of fastq IDs and associated information on each bird sequenced during this round can be found in `WGRS_Azenta_2023_fastq_sample_info.csv`.

Fastq files are on Parchman's storage server (`ponderosa:/backups/rawdata_to_backup/xbill_WGRS/azenta_9_23/30-730065926/00_fastq`), also in a google drive directory in order to share with Andi Kautt.
